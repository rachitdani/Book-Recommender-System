# Book Recommendation System

# About the project:

This is a streamlit web application that can recommend various kinds of similar books based on an user interest the concept of Collaborative based filtering is used here.

# Dataset Link:

# Concept used to build the model.pkl file : NearestNeighbors

1 . Load the data
	
2 . Initialise the value of k

3 . For getting the predicted class, iterate from 1 to total number of training data points

4 . Calculate the distance between test data and each row of training data. Here we will use Euclidean distance as our distance metric since itâ€™s the most popular method. 

5 . Sort the calculated distances in ascending order based on distance values
	
6 . Get top k rows from the sorted array
